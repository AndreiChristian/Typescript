# INTRODUCTION TO TYPESCRIPT

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open source.

### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.

### How is Typescript useful?

Typescript is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This allows the compiler to catch errors before you run the code. It also allows the IDE to provide code completion and other helpful features. By comparison, Javascript is dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable is not known until runtime. This means that the compiler cannot catch errors until you run the code. It also means that the IDE cannot provide code completion and other helpful features.
